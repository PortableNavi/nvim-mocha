## Installation
Clone this repo and copy paste it's contents into `~/.config/nvim`
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/PortableNavi/nvim-mocha
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
cp -r nvim-mocha/* ~/.config/nvim/*
```
After that run `nvim`. Nvim will now download a few plugins, ignore any errors and wait for it to finish. After the installation is finished restart Nvim. That's it!

> If the Errors persist after restrating nvim, consider manually updating nvim-mochas plugins by running `:PackerSync` in nvim
